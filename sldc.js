// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements 1. Planning
// Design                   2. Analysis of requirements
// Implementation           3. Design
// Maintain                 4. Testing & Integration
// Planning                 5. Implementaion
// Testing & Integration    6. Maintain

/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const Analysis = "In this step you conduct a system study to determine all the requirements and resources needed to for the dev team to be successful"
const Design = "a design is created using detailed information regarding the intended functionality of the project, also creates System Design Document"
const Testing = "developed software is checked for funcionality and bugs assuring the specifications of the SDD are met"
